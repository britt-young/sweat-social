## Usage

- Start the server and use a tool for testing API endpoints (I recommend [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download))
- Test the following endpoints:
  - GET routes to return all users and all thoughts
  - GET routes to return a single user and a single thought
  - POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for users
  - POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for thoughts
  - POST and DELETE routes for a userâ€™s friend list
  - POST and DELETE routes for reactions to thoughts
